# eliteApp
Working Hard-Code Json for eliteApi.

No Errors and display is working/showing the best.

I fixed the nested loops of the ng-repeat directives.
    ..Did this by changing the nested <a> tags to <divs>
    ..Also made sure I had closing tags for my <i>.
    ..Looked thru the json in an online viewer to make  
    sure I had the correct data to echo in my html templates.
